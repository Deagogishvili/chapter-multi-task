base_data_loader.py --> the abstract class for the data_loader of our model (how we process the data from the dataset file)
 
base_dataset_loader --> the abstract class for the dataset_loader of our model (how we transform our loaded data into datasets)

base_eval.py --> the abstract class for the eval of our model (how we can evaluate the predictions of our model)

base_model.py --> the abstract class for the model (nothing is implemented yet)

base_predict.py --> the abstract class for the prediction 

base_trainer.py --> the abstract class for the training
